1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix [The algorithm uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all 8 possible directions from each cell in a binary matrix, marking visited cells with their shortest path distance, and returns the shortest path from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1), or -1 if unreachable. ðŸš€]

152. Maximum Product Subarray
[use kadane product lgo. two negative multiplied might be positive]

1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings[while in loop.count max freq and min freq. and sum the difference btw them]

Reverse a LL
check LL is palindrome

12th
907. Sum of Subarray Minimums[can use two pointer but not optimal as we have to traverse whole array. use monotonic stack to store previous minimum and next minimum like next smaller element]
735. Asteroid Collision[Use a stack to simulate asteroid collisions, popping elements when a negative asteroid destroys a positive one, and pushing only surviving asteroids.]
