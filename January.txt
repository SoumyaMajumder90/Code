1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph [we can use both bfs and dfs to create the visited array. if visited array is false then no path is there else there is path]


997. Find the Town Judge [maintain a trustcount array. if a trusts b. decrease a trustcount and increase b trustcount. at end person with trustcount n-1 will be judge]

802. Find Eventual Safe States [not completed]

7th
63. Unique Paths II [memoization- use memo 2d array. if path exist return 1, if not then return 0
		     tabulation- use double for loop for iteration. iteration will be always faster than recursion ]
120. Triangle
	   
111 Mimimum depth of Binary tree [if root is null return 0. if root->left null return 1+(mindepth(root->right) and vice verse. return 1+ min(left, right)]



108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
169 Majority element [using moore voting algorithm]



931. Minimum Falling Path Sum [memoization is giving TLE so go for tabulation/ bottom up approach ]

11th 
45. Jump Game II
179. Largest Number [convert into string and then return]
